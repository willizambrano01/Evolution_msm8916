          CPU hotplug driver designed for ARM big.LITTLE systems where
          both the big and little CPUs are of the same type. On these
          systems, it preferable to normall use the big cluster, and
          only activate the little cluster for highly parallel loads.
          This hotplug implementation always keeps the big cluster
          online, and only activates the little cluster for heavy
          parallel loads.
